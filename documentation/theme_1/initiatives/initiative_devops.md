# Initiative: 
[Develop an intuitive user interface and user experience](https://github.com/amm33/mywebclass-agile-docs/blob/5206bb90d591ccad4944f7af136f8c47f499d0c1/documentation/templates/theme/initiatives/initiativetemp1.md)

## Description
An intuitive user interface ensures that users can easily navigate and interact with the website, while a good user experience ensures that users have a positive impression of the website and are motivated to engage with it.
## Epics
* [Ensure W3C validation and pass Lighthouse audit for accessibility and performance](../../templates/theme/initiatives/epics/epic2.md)
* [Monitor website metrics and use data to improve user experience](../../templates/theme/initiatives/epics/epic3.md)
* [Create and implement modal popups to enhance user engagement and interaction on the website](../../templates/theme/initiatives/epics/epic4.md)

## Test plan
How will this be tested? Automatic and Manual Testing such as: 
* User testing - manual as it will require users to physically visit the site and on multiple devices (iOS, Android, Safari, etc.)
* Use of Lighthouse tool: tests the website's accessibility, performance, and best practices
* Google Analytics
* Unit tests (automated)
