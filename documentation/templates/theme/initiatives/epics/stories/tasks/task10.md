Task Title: Review website for GDPR compliance

User Story: "As a website owner, I want to review the GDPR guidelines to ensure that the website is fully compliant with all regulations."

Description: As a website owner, you need to review your website to ensure that it is fully compliant with GDPR guidelines. This task involves reviewing all areas of the website where personal data is collected, used, and stored, and ensuring that appropriate policies, procedures, and safeguards are in place to protect user data.

To elaborate, we need to implement appropriate security measures to protect the personal data collected. This may include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. We would also have to review data retention policies to ensure that we only retain personal data for as long as necessary. If we use any third-party data processors, such as analytics tools or marketing platforms, we must review their GDPR compliance policies and ensure that they are compliant. We must also test user consent forms, privacy policies, data access and deletion requests, and security measures.
