"Ensure W3C validation and pass Lighthouse audit for accessibility and performance"

Description: Ensuring W3C validation means making sure that the website is accessible to all users, regardless of the device or browser they are using. Passing the Lighthouse audit for accessibility and performance means optimizing the website for fast loading times and easy navigation. 

Goals: 
* Ensure that the website is accessible to all users, regardless of the device or browser they are using.
* Improve the website's performance and accessibility by making necessary changes based on feedback from the Lighthouse tool
* Ensure that the website's code conforms to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
* Ensure that the website is user-friendly and provides a positive user experience.

User Stories: 
* As a website owner, I want to ensure that the website is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, to promote inclusivity and diversity.
* As a website developer, I want to perform regular W3C validation checks during development to identify and fix any issues early on.
* As a website developer, I want to conduct regular performance audits using Lighthouse to identify any areas for optimization and improvement.

Dependencies: 
* Compliance standards - Changes in compliance standards and guidelines may require changes to the website, which can affect the timeline of the epic.
* User feedback - User feedback and testing can identify issues that require changes to the website, which can affect the timeline and scope of the epic.
* Accessibility testing tools - The quality and accuracy of accessibility testing tools, such as Lighthouse, can affect the ability to identify and fix accessibility issues.

Risks: 
* Risk: Unforeseen technical issues may arise that prevent W3C validation and passing Lighthouse audit.
Mitigation strategy: Conduct thorough testing and troubleshooting before launching the website. 
* Risk: Changes in compliance standards may require significant changes to the website design or functionality, leading to delays and increased costs.
Mitigation strategy: Stay up-to-date with compliance standards and guidelines and incorporate them into the website design and development process from the outset.

Estimated Effort: May require significant effort. May involve reviewing and revising code and implementing accessibility features.

Business Value: 
* Improved user experience: By ensuring that the website is accessible and performs well, users are more likely to have a positive experience, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction.
* Compliance with industry standards: Meeting W3C validation and Lighthouse audit requirements demonstrate a commitment to industry standards and can improve the website's reputation.
