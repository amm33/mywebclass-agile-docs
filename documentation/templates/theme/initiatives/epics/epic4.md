"Create and implement modal popups to enhance user engagement and interaction on the website"

Description: Creating and implementing modal popups involves designing and coding pop-up windows that appear on the website to prompt users to take specific actions, such as signing up for a newsletter or downloading a resource. Modal popups can help increase user engagement and improve the overall user experience by providing targeted messaging and opportunities for interaction. 

Goals: 
* Increase user engagement: Modal popups can be used to catch the user's attention and promote engagement with the website.
* Enhance user experience: Modal popups can be used to provide additional information or resources to enhance the user's experience on the website.
* Collect user data through modal popups to better understand user needs and preferences

User Stories: 
* As a user, I want to receive a notification or message when there is a new feature or update on the website, so that I can stay informed and take advantage of new functionality.
* As a website owner, I want to track user engagement with the modal popups using Google Analytics, so that I can analyze and improve their performance over time.

Dependencies:
* Integration with existing website code: The popup implementation may require modifications to existing website code, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
* Testing and optimization: Once the popups are implemented, they will need to be test thoroughly and optimized for performance and user experience.
* Compatibility with GDPR regulations: The popups should be designed and implemented in compliance with GDPR regulations to avoid any potential legal issues.
* User feedback and monitoring: Regular monitoring of user feedback and behavior will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the popups and make necessary adjustments.

Risks: 
* Risks: Popups may annoy users and lead to a negative user experience. Mitigation Strategies: Limit the use of popups to only when necessary and relevant to the user's experience on the website
* Risk: Overuse of popups may lead to users becoming desensitized to them, reducing their effectiveness. Mitigation Strategies: Implement a user feedback system to gather information on the effectiveness of the popups and make adjustments accordingly

Estimated Effort: High
