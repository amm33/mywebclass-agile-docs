"We need to monitor website performance and user engagement using Google Analytics data to inform future development and updates."

Description: The goal of this initiative is to use Google Analytics to monitor website performance and user engagement. By analyzing data collected through Google Analytics, we can identify areas of the website that may need improvement, as well as areas that are performing well.

Goals: 
* Improve website performance by identifying and addressing issues that impact user experience.
* Gain insights into user behavior and preferences to inform future development and updates.
* Increase user engagement and retention by identifying and addressing areas where users may be disengaging from the website. 

User Stories: 
* As a website administrator, I want to integrate Google Analytics tracking code on all website pages, so that we can monitor website performance and user engagement.
* As a website owner, I want to track the number of visitors to my website to better understand its popularity and reach.
* As a website owner, I want to identify any opportunities for optimization or improvement on my website, such as by analyzing user behavior and identifying areas where people are dropping off or getting stuck

Dependencies: 
* Integration with Google Analytics: In order to monitor website performance and user engagement using Google Analytics, there needs to be an integration between the website and the analytics platform.
* Data privacy compliance: The website must comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others when collecting and processing user data.
* Access to data: The team responsible for monitoring website performance and user engagement must have access to the necessary data and analytics tools to perform their tasks.

Risks: 
* Risk: Inaccurate data due to misconfigured Google Analytics account
Mitigation: Regularly review and audit Google Analytics settings to ensure proper tracking and data accuracy. Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the account.
* Risk: Poor data quality due to bot traffic or spam
Mitigation: Implement filters and exclusion settings in Google Analytics to remove bot traffic and spam. Use third-party tools or services to detect and prevent spam.

Estimated Effort: High 

Business Value:
