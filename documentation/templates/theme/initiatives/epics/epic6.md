"Ensure website is GDPR compliant, including obtaining user consent for cookies and providing users with control over their personal data"

Description: This epic involves making sure that the website complies with the GDPR. This includes obtaining user consent for cookies, which are small data files that are stored on a user's device, and providing users with control over their personal data. The goal is to ensure that the website is transparent and respectful of user privacy, which can help to build trust and loyalty among users. 

Goals: 
* Ensure that the website complies with GDPR regulations and requirements.
* Obtain explicit user consent for cookies and clearly communicate how cookies are used on the website.
* Ensure that all data collection and processing activities on the website are lawful, fair, and transparent.

User Stories: 
* As a website owner, I want to review the GDPR guidelines to ensure that the website is fully compliant with all regulations.
* As a website user, I want to be informed about the cookies used on the website and be given the option to accept or reject them.
* As a website owner, I want to create a privacy policy that outlines how user data is collected, used, and protected on the website.

Dependencies: 
* Legal and Regulatory Requirements: The website must comply with various legal and regulatory requirements related to data protection.
* User Awareness: Users should be informed about the website's data collection practices, data usage policies, and their rights related to their personal data. They should be able to provide informed consent for their data to be collected and processed.

Risks: 
* Risk: Legal non-compliance and potential fines: Failure to comply with GDPR regulations could result in legal consequences and potential fines for the company. Mitigation Strategies: Conduct a comprehensive GDPR compliance audit: A thorough audit can identify any gaps in the company's compliance with GDPR regulations and can provide guidance on how to address them.
*Risk: Loss of user trust: If users feel that their personal data is not being properly protected, they may lose trust in the company and may be less likely to use the website or share personal information in the future. Mitigation Strategies: Develop a clear and concise privacy policy: The company should create a privacy policy that is easy to understand and provides users with clear information about how their personal data will be used and protected.

Estimated Effort: High

Business Value: 
* Increased user trust and loyalty: By providing users with greater control over their personal data and being transparent about data collection and usage, the company can build trust and loyalty among its users. 
* Avoidance of potential fines and legal issues: Non-compliance with GDPR regulations can result in significant fines and legal issues. 

Priority: High
